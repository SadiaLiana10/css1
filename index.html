                <h1>Dowry system</h1>
                <p>Dowry means transferring wealth in any 
                    form from the bride’s family to the groom’s.
                     It is a way to showcase love and care and 
                     help the newly wedded couple start their journey 
                     without any difficulty. But with time, it has found 
                     different meanings, and as a result, young girls
                      around the nation suffer from various crimes
                     and domestic.  </p>

                    <a class="tex" href="#">The dowry system brings a dark cloud above the heads of the bride’s family. 
                        Fathers of young girls fear the day of their daughter’s
                         marriage and save money for that particular day.
                          In the northern part of India, the dowry system is quite more prevalent, along with casteism. Dowry is nothing but a nightmare for women. 
                          Every woman goes through the ugly phase, where she is made to feel like she is a liability.

                            To protect young girls from various 
                            dowry-related injustice, reports against dowry are 
                            given priority. But most crimes are never reported, 
                            the domestic violence is at an increasing rate.
                             The lack of proper education and awareness is a
                              major reason for these increasing crimes. 
                              Many young girls are even
